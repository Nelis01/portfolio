            Hello! I'm Nelis Thuo, an experienced data analyst and R programmer with a proven track record of delivering high-quality projects. 
            I specialize in using R to perform data wrangling, statistical analysis, and visualization. 
            Whether it's creating detailed graphs with <strong>ggplot2</strong>, cleaning and transforming data with <strong>dplyr</strong>, or generating reports with <strong>R Markdown</strong>, I bring precision and creativity to every task. 
            I’ve worked on projects ranging from academic research to corporate data analysis, helping teams make data-driven decisions. 
            By turning raw data into meaningful insights, I help businesses and students succeed. Let’s explore data together!
